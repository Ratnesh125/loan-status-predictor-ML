# loan-status-predictor-ML
Introduction
This project focuses on developing a Loan Status Prediction System using machine learning techniques. Fraudulent activities pose significant risks to financial institutions and their customers. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, we can analyze large volumes of data to identify suspicious patterns and behaviors indicative of fraud. The project aims to create an accurate and efficient loan status prediction system to help financial institutions detect and prevent fraudulent activities, safeguarding their assets and ensuring customer trust.
